# websocket-demo

This is a Chat Demo using Websockets.

**WebSocket** is a communication protocol that makes it 
possible to establish a two-way communication 
channel between a server and a client.

**WebSocket** works by first establishing a 
regular HTTP connection with the server 
and then upgrading it to a bidirectional websocket 
connection by sending an Upgrade header.
